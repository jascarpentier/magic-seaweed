# project description 

In this project, I will be building an app that will fetch data from the REI Mountain Project API. You will be able to search across all the rockclimbing routes available in this database. You will be able to see the name of the climb, the type (Trad or Sport), how many pitches it has,  where the location is as well as images of the location. There will be a Home component, a search component, a component that displays the search information that was rendered, a contact us component where users will be prompted to submit their information about new climbs, a blog component and a ...(missing one more component tbd) 

link of API: https://www.mountainproject.com/data

The header will have a video that will be responsive to a photo when it goes to a certain size.

## Issues 

I think that one major promblem that will arrise is that the api i am using doesn't have much documentation about it. It doesn't have documentation about how to specifically hit the api and get the information out of it. 



### POST MVP

I would like to add a Map Api so that people could geo search climbs close to them and see
