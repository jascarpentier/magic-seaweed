# project description 

What's the weather like to climb today? 

In this app, the user will be able to search specific climbing routes in a set longitude & latitude, as well as see what the weather is like for that region. Using the Mountain Porject Api from REI (link of API: https://www.mountainproject.com/data) and the weather Api from Open Weather (https://openweathermap.org). The app will be composed of a Home page where you will be able to see the current Weather Data in the Laurentians at that day, a Climb page where you will be able to search and see the information that the REI Api provides about the climbs in that area, as well as a contact us page where the user may submit a new climb that they have found. The header of the Climb page will have a video that will be responsive to a photo when it goes to a certain size.

## Issues 
The issues i see arrising is mixing multiple different API's together and how to structure everything in my documents. With the REI APi since there is no endpoint i can only search within a set longitude and latitude.


### POST MVP

Post MVP I would like to maybe add a third API. Adding the country api will let users see information of the place that they are looking to climb in.
